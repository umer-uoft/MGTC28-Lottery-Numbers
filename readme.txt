This is my first python program. It's very basic, and quite simple.

It uses the random library to generate a list of six lucky numbers that you could use for Lotto 649. I made use of loops so that the program would be able draw numbers as many times as the user wants.

Instructions:
1) Run the code.
2) Input how many draws you would like to do.
3) The output will be the number of draws you inputted.
